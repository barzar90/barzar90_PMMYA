                            Institution with the RBI on 07 April 2015. MUDRA was launched by the Honâ€™ble Prime

                            Micro enterprises constitute a major economic segment in our country and provides
                            large employment after agriculture. This segment include micro units engaged in
                            manufacturing, processing, trading and services sector. It provides employment to
                            nearly 10 crore people. Many of these units are proprietary/ single ownership or
                            Own Account enterprises and many a time referred as Non Corporate Small Business
                            sector.

                            The Non-Corporate Small Business Sector</h4>
                        <p class="mb">
                            Non-Corporate Small Business Sector (NCSBS) is the economic foundation of India.
                            It is perhaps one of the largest disaggregated business ecosystems in the world
                            sustaining around 50 crore lives.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb">
                            The sector comprises of myriad of small manufacturing units, shopkeepers, fruits
                            / vegetable vendors, truck & taxi operators, food-service units, repair shops, machine
                            operators, small industries, artisans, food processors, street vendors and many
                            others.

                            Formal or institutional architecture has not been able to reach out to them to meet
                            the financial requirements of this sector. They are largely self financed or rely
                            on personal networks or moneylenders. Addressing this need will give a big boost
                            to the economy otherwise this segment would remain unfunded and a portion of the
                            productive labour force would remain unemployed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Small business is big business. According to NSSO Survey (2013), there are 5.77
                            crore small business units, mostly individual proprietorship. Most of these 'own
                            account enterprises' (OAE) are owned by people belonging to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled
                            Tribe or Other Backward Classes. They get very little credit, and that too mostly
                            from non formal lenders, or friends and relatives. Providing access to institutional
                            finance to such micro/small business units would turn them into strong instruments
                            of GDP growth and also employment.

                            The biggest bottleneck to the growth of entrepreneurship in the NCSBS is lack of
                            financial support to this sector. The support from the Banks to this sector is meagre,
                            with less than 15% of bank credit going to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).

                            A vast part of the non-corporate sector operates as unregistered enterprises. They
                            do not maintain proper Books of Accounts and are not formally covered under taxation
                            areas. Therefore, the banks find it difficult to lend to them. Majority of this
                            sector does not access outside sources of finance.

                            The GOI Press release of 2 March 2015 has laid down the roles and responsibilities

                            Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) was launched along with the launching of MUDRA
                            on 08 April 2015 and the detailed guidelines were issued by Government of India
                            to all banks and MFIs. MUDRA was given the responsibility of monitoring the programme
                            by collecting the information on regular basis. Accordingly, MUDRA has put in place
                            a monitoring portal which captures the data on lending under PMMY, in a granular
                            fashion.
