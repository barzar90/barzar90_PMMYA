                        Traditional financing in Indian context adopts an Asset Based lending approach with
                        emphasis on collaterals. Micro units, most of the times, are unable to provide the
                        comfort of collaterals. Hence MUDRA loans i.e. loans upto <i class="icon-rupee"></i> 10 lakh, have been
                        made collateral free, as per the RBI norms in this regard.

                        To mitigate the issue of collaterals, MUDRA is offering a Credit Guarantee Product.
                        MUDRA Credit Guarantee is extended by creation of a Fund called <strong>“Credit Guarantee
                            Fund for Micro Units” [CGFMU]</strong> and the scheme has been notified by GoI
                        vide its notification dated April 18, 2016. Accordingly, all eligible micro loans
                        sanctioned since April 08, 2015 is covered under the Scheme. The Scheme is being
                        managed by National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd. [NCGTC], an agency promoted
                        by the GOI.

                        Further, given the context of the industry /segment, since the individual loan sizes
                        would expectedly be small and number of loans will be large, Mudra Credit Guarantee
                        scheme provide a Portfolio Guarantee. Under this, Credit Guarantee or Risk Sharing
                        is provided for a portfolio of homogenous loans instead of a Scheme for individual
                        loan - by - loan guarantee. This is expected to create administrative efficiencies
                        and increase receptiveness for the Credit Guarantee product. The Guarantee product
                        is one of the key interventions proposed with the objective of bringing down the

                            Accreditation / rating of MFI entities is one of the roles earmarked for MUDRA.
                            Further, a segment of financial intermediaries for the non corporate small business
                            sector is envisaged to emerge in the financing architecture. MUDRA would work in
                            coordination with Rating Agencies so that appropriate rating framework (s) which
                            take into account sector specific features are devised for various sector participants.
                            In the longer run, availability of rating for sector participants would facilitate
                            formalization and further flow of capital to the sector.</p>

                            Access to finance is critical and equally critical is the cost of finance to the
                            NCSB/ultimate beneficiary. The funds mobilized by micro units from the informal
                            sources are at a high cost. There is scope for cost rationalization. However, the
                            rationalization is intricately linked with the cost of funds for the last mile MFIs.</p>
                        <p class="mb">
                            GOI while announcing the formation of MUDRA also announced a refinance corpus for
                            MUDRA at 20000 crores, to be allocated by RBI from the Priority Sector lending shortfall.
                            Accordingly, RBI has provided the allocation which helps in bringing down the cost
                            of lending at the ultimate borrower level as MUDRA refinance will reduce the average
                            borrowing cost of the lending institutions</p>
                        <p class="mb">
                            The NBFC-MFIs are presently regulated by Reserve Bank of India and RBI has already
                            prescribed detailed guidelines for margin cap in respect of MFIs. The margin cap
                            has been pegged at 10% for MFIs having loan portfolio of more than 100 crore and
                            12% for smaller MFIs having loan portfolio of less than 100 crore or 2.75 times
                            the average base rate of five major commercial banks, whichever is less. In the
                            backdrop of these guidelines and the fact that MFI sector has been constantly trying
                            to reduce its costs, MUDRA would also help MFIs reduce their cost to bring down
                            the overall cost to the end beneficiaries. Further, at the time of appraisal, MUDRA
                            would be studying / assessing individual MFIs on this as well as other related parameters
                            and suitably price its assistance based on such assessment.</p>

                            In the case of Banks, RBI has also put a cap on the interest rate at Base rate/
                            MCLR for lending micro units by Commercial Banks by availing of MUDRA refinance.
                            Similarly, the RRBs and Cooperatives have been given a interest cap of 3.50% over
                            and above MUDRA refinance rate, while lending to MUDRA loan by availing of MUDRA
                            refinance.</p>
                        <p class="mb">
                            In case of NBFCs, RBI has also stipulated a interest cap of 6% over and above MUDRA
                            refinance while their lending to MUDRA segment.</p>
                        <p>
                            All these are expected to have a positive impact on the pricing of MUDRA loans in
                            the country whereby the Micro enterprises will be able to avail of credit at a affordable
                            interest rate. But, first and foremost objective is to ensure accessibility of credit.</p>
